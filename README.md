# Prague Tram AC app

Have you ever thought that Prague is too hot in the summer? Me too! Did you know that the official API has the information about air conditioning, but none of the official apps display it?

This repository contains an app, that displays all trams leaving from a stop of your choice and shows whether it has AC or not.

Check it out on [too-hot.zavodny.net](https://too-hot.zavodny.net).
